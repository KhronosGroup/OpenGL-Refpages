KHRONOS NOTE: the SGI Free Software License B was originally hosted by
Silicon Graphics, Inc. at http://oss.sgi.com/projects/FreeB/ . SGI was
eventually acquired by Hewlett-Packard Corporation, and that website is
longer accessible.

Khronos has downloaded the last available version of the license from the
Internet Archive snapshot taken February 15, 2017, at URL
https://web.archive.org/web/20170215084416/http://oss.sgi.com/projects/FreeB/

The text of the license from that snapshot is included below and is believed
to be correct. The website asserts that "Other than the added option to
refer to the License's website, the terms of the version 2.0 License are
identical to the terms of the X11 license.")
