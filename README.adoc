= OpenGL-Refpages

OpenGL^R^ and OpenGL ES reference page sources, and generated HTML used
as backing store for khronos.org .

== Directory Structure

There are separate ref page sets for each of the following apis:

* +es1.1+ - OpenGL ES 1.1 (fixed function)
* +es2.0+ - OpenGL ES 2.0
* +es3.0+ - OpenGL ES 3.0
* +es3.1+ - OpenGL ES 3.1
* +es3+ - OpenGL ES 3.x (will always be the latest ES, currently 3.2)
* +gl2.1+ - OpenGL 2.1 (including fixed functionality)
* +gl4+ - OpenGL 4.x (will always be the latest GL, currently 4.5)

== Building

The ref pages rely on the Docbook 4 and 5 toolchains, DTDs, XSL, etc.
Tools you'll need to build include:

* xsltproc (Debian 'xsltproc' package, might also be 'libxslt').
* Docbook stylesheets (Debian 'docbook-xsl' and 'docbook-xsl-ns' packages,
  might also be 'docbook-style-xsl').
** If your XML catalog does not resolve the stylesheet URIs in the man
   page sources to a local reference to the installed stylesheets,
   processing will be very, very slow. You can find out if this is
   happening by invoking one of the xsltproc commands in the build with
   the '--nonet' argument.
* MathML 2.0 DTD (Debian 'w3-dtd-mathml' package)
* Docboook MathML Module 1.1 (Debian 'docbook-mathml' package, or
  install http://www.docbook.org/xml/mathml/1.1CR1/dbmathml.dtd into
  your local XML catalog).
* GNU Make.

If you're using Ubuntu, or the Windows 10 Ubuntu subsystem, the required
package names are probably basically the same as Debian.

On MacOSx, you can install 'docbook' and 'docbook-xls' from homebrew. In order to view equations correctly, you can copy the Docbook MathML module into the subdirectories for the OpenGL versions. xsltproc should be on your system, but you may need to install 'xcode-tools'.

It's possible to build the ref pages on Cygwin, but we
don't have current package names or instructions for those environments.
If you do, please submit a pull request adding details to this README.

== Ref Pages in Subversion are Deprecated

The reference pages were formerly maintained in Khronos Subversion. The
Subversion copies will not be removed, but are no longer being
maintained or exposed via the opengl.org and khronos.org websites.

== Future Plans

We're interested in migrating from Docbook to asciidoc, but if and only
if we can find a robust way to automatically convert Docbook <refentry>
documents into asciidoc, including handling XIncludes, imbedded MathML
into LaTeX math, etc. We've tried several XSLT scripts and other
conversion tools without success.

We'll accept reasonable pull requests to improve the current ref pages,
but aren't going to put a lot of effort into them ourselves.

== Licenses

For historical reasons, the ref pages are under a mix of open source
licenses from Khronos, SGI, 3Dlabs, and others. We are unable to change
many of those licenses, because the original authors are no longer in
business (SGI, 3Dlabs). Ideally we'd like to end up with a Creative
Commons license on all the ref pages and Apache 2.0 on all the scripts
and tools, but it's unlikely that will ever be possible.

The SGI Free Software B License used on some of the pages is no longer
hosted at the original location on SGI's webservers, following their
acquisition. Instead, we host a copy in LICENSES/LicenseRef-FreeB.txt, and
have updated copyright links in the reference pages to this file.
